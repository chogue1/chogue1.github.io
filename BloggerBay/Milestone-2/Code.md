## BloggerBay - Test-driven development workflow

### Build a simple app
A simple web application is hosted under PythonAnywhere @ BloggerBay.pythonanywhere.com

### Build a simple test
Under https://github.com/chogue1/chogue1.github.io/blob/master/BloggerBay/pages/tests.py uses 
SimpleTestCase, which is used because no databases exist in the application. It tests the urls,
if the page is missing, and if there are no templates.

### Document workflow built around tests
