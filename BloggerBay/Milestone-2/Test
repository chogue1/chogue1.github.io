Each level of the hierarchy produces increasing levels of detail.  Test planning should always start at the top and work down. This prevents getting lost
in the weeds and running out of time.

A typical medium-sized app can be built in about 1000 hours of engineering time.  This means that about 250 hours should be spent on testing.  The
testing hierarchy acts as a natural budget for how to spent that time.
