## App Description: 
    
        This app will allow the user to build a blog, allowing other users to post articles. Users
        will have to log in, and will have their own profile page. The app will allow logged in users to
        search through other users posted articles and leave comments on them. Users will also be
        able to start an article, and save it without publishing it.
