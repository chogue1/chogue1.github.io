## Blogger Bay - Version control

All code for Blogger Bay lives in git repos at Github. This includes the application 
source code, the documents for development, and the customer website used for marketing.
Github also houses all of the project management team documentation that was created during
the project development cycle: wiki, issues, project kanban, and instant messages.

Github is at the heart of every aspect of the Blogger bay project.  If it is not at Github
then it does not truly exist.

### Publishing Project Docs

Project docs will be published via Github through the use of Markdown. 

### WorkFlow guide

Rapid-application development (RAD)

Rapid Prototyping

1. prototype: The team creates an initial prototype. This is a visual representation of the design specifications as set out in the requirements document. The prototype may be either low-fidelity or high-fidelity (more to come on high- and low-fidelity prototypes) and may be interactive or non-interactive.

2. Feedback: The creators share the prototype with other team members, stakeholders, and focus groups made up the intended end-users. Everyone evaluates both the design and usability before submitting feedback.

3. Improvement: The feedback is used to create a new iteration of the prototype. The process then cycles round to Step 2 for further feedback. This continues until there are no more changes or a specified cut-off is reached (either a date or number of iterations).
